To limit access to your data source, you must take precautions to help secure connection information such as a user ID, password, and data source name. Storing a user ID and password in plain text, such as in your source code, presents a serious security issue. Even if you supply a compiled version of code that contains user ID and password information in an external source, your compiled code can potentially be disassembled and the user ID and password exposed. As a result, it is imperative that critical information such as a user ID and password not exist in your code. </p><p>It is strongly recommended that you not store the password together with the connection URL in application source code. Instead, consider storing the password in a separate file that has restricted access. The access to that file can be granted to the context under which the application is running. </p><p>Another approach is to store the encrypted password in a file. Make sure that you use an encryption API that does not require the key to be stored somewhere and is not derived from the password of a user. For example, you might consider using certificate-based public/private key pairs, or use an approach where two parties use a key agreement protocol (Diffie-Hellman algorithm) to generate identical secret keys for encryption without ever having to transmit the secret key. </p><p>If you take connection string information from an external source, such as a user supplying a user ID and password, you must validate any input from the source to ensure that it follows the correct format and does not contain additional parameters that affect your connection.</p></div><span id="seeAlsoSpan"><h1 class="heading">See Also</h1></span><div id="seeAlsoSection" class="section" name="collapseableSection" style=""><div class="seeAlsoStyle"><span sdata="link"><a href="90724ec6-a9cb-43ef-903e-793f89410bc0.htm">Securing JDBC Driver Applications</a></span></div></div></div><div id="footer" class="section"><span id="feedbackarea">Send <a href="javascript:SubmitFeedback('DevDocs@Microsoft.com','','','','01.00.12024.10000','%0\dThank%20you%20for%20your%20feedback.%20The%20developer%20writing%20teams%20use%20your%20feedback%20to%20improve%20documentation.%20While%20we%20are%20reviewing%20your%20feedback,%20we%20may%20send%20you%20e-mail%20to%20ask%20for%20clarification%20or%20feedback%20on%20a%20solution.%20We%20do%20not%20use%20your%20e-mail%20address%20for%20any%20other%20purpose%20and%20we%20delete%20it%20after%20we%20finish%20our%20review.%0\AFor%20further%20information%20about%20the%20privacy%20policies%20of%20Microsoft,%20please%20see%20http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx.%0\A%0\d','Customer%20Feedback');">feedback</a> on this topic to Microsoft.</span><span id="copyrightarea"><p><a href="9bad553b-9e70-4696-8499-2e35f772a1e0.htm">© 2012 Microsoft.
